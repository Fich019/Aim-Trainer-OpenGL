# 2020-COMP3016-Coursework2
This is the repo readme for coursework 2 of COMP3016.
This repo will contain the projects files for my aim trainer designed and built in openGL.


# User Interactions
The user interacts with software by using mouse and keyboard controls.  
  
**Controls:**  
**W, A, S, D** - Move the player around the scene  
**Mouse Look** - Alows the user to look around inside of the scene  
**Left Mouse Button** - Lets the user interact and "shoot" at the targets in the scene  
**Scroll Wheel** - Lets the user change the fov of the camera (zoom in and out) as they see fit.  
 
The program can be opened by running the .exe located in the release folder in the github(as of right now the build doesn't work as intended and doesn't run properly) **OR** by opening the .sln file and running it through visual studio.
  
# Project Layout
  My project is a aim trainer built inside of OPENGL. I started with a camera and player movement script from learnOpenGL and a shader and built up from there. I started by creating walls, a floor and a ceiling to enclose the player in a box. From there I stopped the player leaving said box so they would remain in the playable area. There is a different coloured wall on the back which draws the players eyes to it. This is the main wall where the targets are located. The player can then aim at the targets with the crosshair provided on screen and use left click on their mouse to "shoot" at them and destroy them. The target is then randomly placed somewhere else on the wall. I got the idea from playing first person games myself, I want somewhere to warm up my aim and to practice before playing. Granted this has already been done before many times but I wanted to have a go at as it is something that I am interested in and enjoy. It combines my interests into one.
